# Update Packages

## First Step: Create Branch (MANDATORY)

Before touching any packages, create a dedicated branch:

```bash
but branch new chore/update-packages-$(date +%y%m%d-%H%M)
```

**Rules:**
- Never reuse an existing update-packages branch
- Always create a fresh branch with the current timestamp
- All package update commits go to this branch

## Definition of Done

- `bun upgrade` shows all packages at latest versions
- No packages remain to select or update
- All checks pass (`bun run check`)
- All relevant tests pass

## If Bun Updates

When the Bun runtime itself has a new version:

1. Update `packageManager` field in root `package.json`:
   ```json
   "packageManager": "bun@X.Y.Z"
   ```

2. Update all Dockerfiles that reference `BUN_VERSION`:
   ```dockerfile
   ARG BUN_VERSION=X.Y.Z
   ```

3. Update CI pipeline `BUN_VERSION` environment variable in all relevant pipeline files.

4. Run checks to confirm nothing broke:
   ```bash
   bun run check
   ```

5. Commit message format:
   ```
   chore: update bun to vX.Y.Z
   ```

## If Playwright Updates

When `@playwright/test` or `playwright` npm version changes:

1. The Docker image version **must match** the npm package version exactly.

2. Find all references to the Playwright Docker image across:
   - `Dockerfile` files
   - CI/CD pipeline YAML files
   - Kubernetes Helm values files
   - Any other infrastructure files

3. Update all references to use the matching image tag:
   ```
   mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:vX.Y.Z-noble
   ```

4. Run E2E tests to confirm compatibility:
   ```bash
   bun run test:e2e
   ```

5. Commit message format:
   ```
   chore: update playwright to vX.Y.Z
   ```

## Catalog Packages

Some packages are managed via Bun's catalog and require manual version checking:

```bash
# Check latest version of a catalog package
npm view <package-name> version

# Check all versions available
npm view <package-name> versions --json
```

Update catalog entries in `package.json` or `bun.lockb` manually after confirming the latest version.

## Package Groups (Update Together)

These packages must always be updated as a group — mismatched versions cause type errors or runtime failures:

| Group | Packages |
|-------|----------|
| **tanstack-router** | `@tanstack/react-router`, `@tanstack/router-devtools`, `@tanstack/router-plugin`, `@tanstack/start` |
| **tanstack-query** | `@tanstack/react-query`, `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`, `@tanstack/query-core` |
| **trpc** | `@trpc/server`, `@trpc/client`, `@trpc/react-query`, `@trpc/tanstack-react-query` |
| **effect** | `effect`, `@effect/schema`, `@effect/platform`, `@effect/language-service` |
| **drizzle** | `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit`, `drizzle-zod` |
| **pino** | `pino`, `pino-pretty`, `@types/pino` |
| **playwright** | `@playwright/test`, `playwright` (+ Docker image sync — see above) |

## Update Strategy

**For regular packages:**
1. Run `bun upgrade` to update all packages interactively
2. Select packages to update (prefer updating all unless a known breaking change exists)
3. Run `bun run check` after each group update
4. Fix any breaking changes before proceeding to the next group

**For catalog packages:**
1. Manually check latest version with `npm view <package> version`
2. Update the version in the catalog configuration
3. Run `bun install` to apply
4. Run `bun run check`

## Release Notes Analysis (MANDATORY)

For every **minor** or **major** version bump, check GitHub release notes for changes relevant to the project. Skip patch-only updates.

### How

1. After `bun upgrade`, identify all minor/major bumps
2. Get repo URL via `npm view <package> repository.url`
3. Read releases with `gh release view <tag> --repo <owner/repo>` (fallback: `CHANGELOG.md`)
4. For **major**: look for breaking changes, migration guides, removed APIs
5. For **minor**: look for new APIs, opt-in perf improvements, deprecations
6. Map each finding against actual project codebase — search for usages, identify affected files, and provide concrete fix/adoption suggestions

### Report

Output a summary table after all updates:

```
| Package | Type | Old → New | Changes | Impact & Suggestions |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| effect | MAJOR | 3.x → 4.0 | `Layer` API redesigned | ⚠️ 12 files use `Layer.succeed` → must change to `Layer.sync`. Files: src/services/Auth.ts:14, src/services/Db.ts:8, ... See migration: https://... |
| drizzle-orm | MINOR | 0.38 → 0.39 | `.having()` support | ❌ No aggregate queries in project |
| @tanstack/react-router | MINOR | 1.90 → 1.91 | `beforeLoad` abort signal | ✅ src/routes/dashboard.tsx:23 has slow loader — add `abortSignal` to cancel stale fetches. Suggested diff: `beforeLoad: ({ abortController }) => ...` |
```

### Parallelization

Parallelize via background subagents. Packages from the same ecosystem (per Package Groups table above) share one subagent. Standalone packages get one subagent each. Each subagent reads release notes AND searches the project codebase for affected usages. Merge results into a single report.

### Rules

- Each subagent MUST search the codebase for usages of changed/deprecated/new APIs
- For breaking changes: list all affected files with line numbers and provide migration snippets
- For new features: identify where in the project they could be adopted and show suggested code changes
- Do NOT apply changes — provide diffs/suggestions only, user decides
- Do NOT block updates on this analysis — update first, analyze after
- Packages with no releases/changelog → "no release notes available", move on
## Testing Requirements

| Update Type | Required Tests |
|-------------|----------------|
| UI/component packages (`@base-ui/react`, etc.) | `bun run check` + visual review in browser |
| TRPC / TanStack Router | `bun run check` + `bun run test` |
| Drizzle ORM | `bun run check` + `bun run test` |
| Effect packages | `bun run check` + `bun run test` |
| Playwright | `bun run check` + `bun run test:e2e` |
| Bun runtime | `bun run check` + `bun run test` + `bun run test:e2e` |
| All others | `bun run check` |

## Cache Recovery (Bun)

If packages fail to install or you see stale cache errors after updating:

```bash
bun clean:packages && bun install
```

This clears the local package cache and performs a fresh install.

## Common Breaking Changes

| Package | Common Issue | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `@effect/language-service` | Version must match `effect` core exactly | Always update together with `effect` |
| `@types/react` | React 19 types changed significantly; some third-party types conflict | Check peer deps, may need `--legacy-peer-deps` workaround or type overrides |
| `@base-ui/react` | API surface changes frequently in pre-stable releases | Review changelog, update component usage accordingly |

## Guardrails

- **DO NOT** update packages with `workspace:*` version specifiers — these are internal monorepo packages managed separately
- **DO NOT** skip `@typescript/native-preview` updates — this package affects TypeScript LSP performance and should stay current
- **DO NOT** use `bun outdated` to check for updates — it misses packages that are in the catalog or have non-standard version specifiers; use `bun upgrade` interactively instead
